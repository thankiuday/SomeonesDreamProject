## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend
- [ ] **Create Web Service on Render**
  - [ ] Connect GitHub repository
  - [ ] Set root directory to `backend`
  - [ ] Set build command to `npm install`
  - [ ] Set start command to `npm start`
  - [ ] Set environment variables (see above)
  - [ ] Deploy and wait for success

- [ ] **Verify Backend Deployment**
  - [ ] Health check endpoint works: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/health`
  - [ ] Check logs for any errors
  - [ ] Test database connection

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend
- [ ] **Create Static Site on Render**
  - [ ] Connect same GitHub repository
  - [ ] Set root directory to `frontend`
  - [ ] Set build command to `npm install && npm run build`
  - [ ] Set publish directory to `dist`
  - [ ] Set environment variables (see above)
  - [ ] Deploy and wait for success

- [ ] **Verify Frontend Deployment**
  - [ ] Site loads without errors
  - [ ] Check console for any JavaScript errors
  - [ ] Test API connection

### Step 3: Update Configuration
- [ ] **Update Backend CORS**
  - [ ] Update `FRONTEND_URL` in backend environment variables
  - [ ] Redeploy backend if necessary

- [ ] **Test Full Application**
  - [ ] User registration/login
  - [ ] Video calls
  - [ ] Messaging
  - [ ] File uploads
  - [ ] All major features

## ðŸ”§ Post-Deployment

### Monitoring
- [ ] **Set up monitoring**
  - [ ] Enable Render's built-in monitoring
  - [ ] Set up alerts for downtime
  - [ ] Monitor resource usage

### Security
- [ ] **Security review**
  - [ ] All environment variables are set correctly
  - [ ] No sensitive data exposed
  - [ ] HTTPS is working
  - [ ] CORS is properly configured

### Performance
- [ ] **Performance testing**
  - [ ] Test video call quality
  - [ ] Test file upload speeds
  - [ ] Monitor response times
  - [ ] Check for memory leaks

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- [ ] **Build fails**
  - [ ] Check Node.js version compatibility
  - [ ] Verify all dependencies are in package.json
  - [ ] Check build logs for specific errors

- [ ] **Database connection fails**
  - [ ] Verify MongoDB URI is correct
  - [ ] Check IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas
  - [ ] Verify database user permissions

- [ ] **CORS errors**
  - [ ] Check FRONTEND_URL is set correctly
  - [ ] Verify frontend URL matches exactly
  - [ ] Check CORS configuration in security.js

- [ ] **Environment variables not working**
  - [ ] Verify variables are set in Render dashboard
  - [ ] Check for typos in variable names
  - [ ] Redeploy after adding new variables

### Health Checks
- [ ] **Backend health**: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/health`
- [ ] **Frontend**: Your frontend URL
- [ ] **Database**: Check MongoDB Atlas dashboard
- [ ] **Stream Chat**: Test API credentials
