# 🔧 Rate Limit Fix - 429 Errors

## 🚨 Current Issue
- ✅ CORS issue resolved (no more CORS errors)
- ❌ Getting 429 (Too Many Requests) errors on signup/login
- ❌ Rate limiting is too strict for production usage

## 🔍 Root Cause
The rate limiting configuration was set too low for production:
- **Auth endpoints**: Only 5 requests per 15 minutes (way too low!)
- **General endpoints**: Only 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **Link code endpoints**: Only 3 requests per 15 minutes

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Updated Rate Limits (backend/src/config/security.js)

**Before:**
```javascript
auth: {
  max: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? 100 : 5, // Too low!
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
auth: {
  max: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? 100 : 50, // Much better!
}
```

### New Rate Limit Configuration

| Endpoint Type | Development | Production | Time Window |
|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| General | 1000 requests | 500 requests | 15 minutes |
| Auth | 100 requests | 50 requests | 15 minutes |
| Link Code | 50 requests | 20 requests | 15 minutes |

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Configuration
1. **Commit and push** the updated rate limiting configuration
2. **Trigger manual deploy** in your Render dashboard for the backend service

### Step 2: Test After Deployment
After deployment, test the endpoints:

```bash
# Test auth endpoint
curl -X POST https://someonesdreamproject.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"testpassword"}'

# Test health endpoint
curl https://someonesdreamproject.onrender.com/api/health
```

### Step 3: Verify in Browser
1. Open your frontend application
2. Try to sign up or log in
3. Check browser console for any 429 errors
4. Should see normal 401/200 responses instead of 429

## 🎯 Expected Results

After deploying the updated rate limiting:

- ✅ No more 429 errors on signup/login
- ✅ Normal authentication flow works
- ✅ Users can retry login attempts without being blocked
- ✅ General API usage is not restricted
- ✅ Still protected against abuse (50 auth attempts per 15 minutes is reasonable)

## 🔍 Testing

Run the rate limit test to verify:

```bash
node backend/test-rate-limit.js
```

This will test the rate limiting configuration and show you the current limits.

## 📋 Checklist

- [ ] Rate limiting configuration updated
- [ ] Backend deployed with new configuration
- [ ] No 429 errors on signup/login
- [ ] Authentication flow works normally
- [ ] Rate limiting still provides protection against abuse

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

### Check Current Rate Limits
If you're still getting 429 errors after deployment:

1. **Wait 15 minutes** - Rate limits reset after the time window
2. **Check deployment logs** - Ensure the new configuration was deployed
3. **Test with curl** - Use the test commands above
4. **Clear browser cache** - Sometimes cached responses can cause issues

### Emergency Override
If needed, you can temporarily disable rate limiting by setting:

```javascript
// In backend/src/config/security.js
development: {
  disableRateLimit: true, // Temporarily disable
  disableHelmet: process.env.DISABLE_HELMET === "true",
},
```

**⚠️ WARNING: Only use this for testing, not production!**

**Status**: Ready for deployment
**Priority**: HIGH - Rate limiting blocking authentication
